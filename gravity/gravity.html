		<h3>What's this?</h3>
		<p>
			This is a gravity simulator. It's not very good. I don't know a lot of math.
			<br>Maybe it would be better if you imagined this with cubes. Bouncy cubes. Floating on bouncy water.
			<br>Or they have really tiny wheels. The circles are round because originally they were planets.
			<br>That's why this is called "Gravity". Because the circles themselves had gravity.
			<br>Anyways, you know Angry Birds? How you pull back on them and they move when you let go?
			<br>You can play with the imaginary cubes like that.
