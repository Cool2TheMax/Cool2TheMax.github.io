		<h3>To whom it may concern.</h3>
		<p>
			This is mainly Solon or whoever he was going to tell, but I lowkey don't have a lot on this.
			<br> So, this is filler. In case y'all couldn't pick up on the context clues, I'm Max.
			<br> max1 is a psuedonym. My cool Internet one. I got limited CSS and html skills.
			<br>The retro green and black isn't a theme, I just don't want to do anymore.
			<br>But, what I am good at is JavaScript :D (that's very up for debate)
		</p>
		<h3>And these, are my projects.</h3>
