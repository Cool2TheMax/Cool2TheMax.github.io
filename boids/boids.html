			Ok. I lied. I know that when you clicked on this, you expected a flocking simulation
			<br>and a competent code writer. But you were altogether decieved when you found a single,
			<br>lone, flier. And one that you operate with arrow keys? A scam! So, yes, this is a work in progress, but
			<br>I still need to show of JavaScript, so here!
